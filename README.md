# covid-19-recoveries-europe-latam

An overview of the Covid-19 recoveries to-date in Europe and LATAM (Brazil). The analysis was done using Python.

Data pre-processing was done, along with visual data comparisons of global confirmed cases vs recoveries. Following this, visual comparisons were done for Spain, Italy and Germany, which are the worst hit countries in Europe, and Brazil, the worst hit country in Latin America(LATAM).

Finally, as a small contribution to the research community, and to project in some positivity in these negative and challenging times, a prediction was done, modeling the forecasting of the recoveries in the above countries. The data was of time series format, and forecasting was performed using Facebook's Prophet model.

Thank you to John Hopkins University, for providing the dataset containing the confirmed cases and recoveries, automated to refresh every day, to perform my research. The link is https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series.
